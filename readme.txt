ManderApp is a small code collection used for a few applications published by
the author.

This code alone will serve not much of a purpose. Don't bother downloading
unless it is a submodule of another repository.

Nah, don't bother.


History:
--------
This code collection is what it is: A super-layer above some applications
distributed by the author. Originally, all applications were created as
standalone apps but with time, the same things were used again and again.
And so, some of that repetitive code was combined into this collection.

When going to GitHub, the code had been completely rewritten in C and
found its way into the following applications:
- Karo Graph
- Bit Fiddle
- Color Machine
- Matrix Buddy
- UTC Scroll
